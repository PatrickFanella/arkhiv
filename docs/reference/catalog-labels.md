# Catalog labels

Core 0.4.6 adds typed labels for catalog items: `topic`, `place`, `organization`,
`person` and `event`. A label has a stable ID (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{0,99}$`), a
display label, aliases and a description. Assignments link an item to a label
with a state, a method, a score and evidence.

States are `proposed`, `accepted` and `rejected`. Only accepted assignments are
visible through the API, in public and private audiences alike. A proposal is a
suggestion from a method (a lexicon, a model, an editor) and stays private until
an operator accepts it. Every proposal and decision is recorded in
`catalog_label_history` with its notes.

Operator commands:

```sh
vhness import-labels --file vocabulary.json            # [{id, kind, label, aliases, description}]
vhness propose-labels --file proposals.json --notes …  # [{item, label, method, score, evidence}]
vhness review-labels --file decisions.json --notes …   # [{item, label, state}]
```

`import-labels` upserts the vocabulary; a label's kind cannot change while it is
assigned. `propose-labels` refreshes existing proposals but never overwrites an
accepted or rejected assignment, so a rerun cannot undo a review. Unknown items
or labels fail the whole batch. `review-labels` changes the state of existing
assignments, including moving one back to `proposed`.

HTTP:

- `GET /api/catalog/v1/labels?collection=&kind=` lists accepted labels on items
  visible in the audience scope, with item counts.
- `GET /api/catalog/v1/items?label=ID` filters by an accepted label, and items
  include their accepted `labels`.

Evidence is stored for review and is not exposed by the API. Keep generated
proposals reproducible: record the method version and the inputs it read.
